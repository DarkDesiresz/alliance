<!-----------------------Hour of Code Section by Nuraddin ---------------------------->

<section id="Hourofcode">
<div class ="container">
<h1 class = "title text-center">HOUR OF CODE </h1>
<div class="col-md-6">


<h3 class="horh3">World One Hour of Code event</h3>
<p class ="hrotext">First and foremost, our team has collaborated amongst itself and has prepared a very entertaining program for our students, the outline of which will be detailed in the sections below, and thus we have proceeded with firstly introducing the lector of the class, Nuraddin, the assistant, Shamil, and sub-code assistants, Farid and Huseyn. Afterwards, we have swiftly commenced with our Canva presentation, prepared beforehand, and have spoken about the prospects of studying at ADA University at the faculty school of IT and Engineering. There we have communicated main positive aspects of studying at ADA university, its challenges and rewarding aspects of receiving education from ADA, along with answering vital questions from students regarding admission.
    With regards to the second part of the Hour of Code event, we proceeded to the theoretical part of the lesson, where we gave a concise definition of what algorithms are and how they are applied in the spheres of IT and engineering. 
<br>
<br>
    The third part of the lesson was one of the main parts of the Hour of Code, where we provided instructions for the students to firstly open code.org, proceed with creating accounts for them, and guide them as they started doing their very first tasks in the angry bird "write your first program" game. As the students progressed throughout the course, we took notice of how eager and interested they were in solving these simple tasks. While the school students were solving problems, sub-code assistants were doing their best to assist them with any problems that they encountered throughout their learning process, while the main lecturers were taking part in recording and observing the classroom.
<br>
<br>
    Finally, as the event was coming to an end, we distributed a reflection/feedback survey paper to all the students. We discovered that the results were mostly positive, and as well as the feedback, some students went so far as to write suggestions for our team.</p>

<!------------------------Website Project Information ------------------------------------------------------->


<section id="Website-Project-Information">
<div class ="container">
<h1 class="title text-center">Website Project information</h1>
<div class="col-md-4">

<hp class = "h3text text-center"> This section is about the flow and the development of our website. First and foremost, our team has set up Github accounts and other essential programs like vs code to start work on our website.
Afterwards, we have disperesed roles among each other and planned the layout of the website. We wated to make the website with a simplistic look and a navbar menu which could be used to drop down to 4 main sections of 
the website. 
<br>
<br>
We have also included transparent pictures and engaging text in the homepage to attract the readers attention. Consequently, we have included information about the team members and followed the instructions
provided to us. To stand out, we have decided to include everything on one page, and to make it a little bit responsive, we took the decision to change the speed of dropdowns from the menu using Javascrtipt.
